## detects_ripple_candidates.py
This script takes about 7h.

## checks_candi.py
This sciprt checks if newly determined ripple candidates are identical with already calculated ripple candidates. This is especially helpful because **./detect_ripple_candidates.py** takes a lot of time.


## extracts_bands_magnitudes.py
This script creates magnitude of filtered signals. The outputs are like "./data/01/day1/split/LFP_MEP_1kHz_npy/tt2-1_mep_magni_sd_fp16.npy."
