The recording environment was as follows:
Day1: HOME cage

The recording started just before entering a night cycle.

Video capturing timings were recorded as "analog input", which is in NS4 file.

Tetrodes were inserted in the right hippocampus (AP:-1.8, LM:+2.0). Tetrode-inserting operations were performed in the following order: tt6, tt2, tt7, tt3 (from medial to temporal direction).


## Details
analog input: During rectangular waves are injected, the video capturing were performed.
      tt2, 6: LFP (= local field potential) in the hippocampus
         tt8: MEP (= myoelectric potential) in the trapezius
