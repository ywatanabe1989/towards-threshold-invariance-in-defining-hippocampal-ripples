LFP
The raw (1250Hz, all channels) LFP will be stored in a baseName.lfp file, a la neuroscope. This file has the LFP data for every channel in the recording, and channels are 0-indexed. LFP can be loaded into a buzcode lfp structure in matlab using the I/O function bz_GetLFP.

An additional .lfp.mat file format is also available for storage processed LFP data or LFP from select channels. For example, one could store the wavelet spectrum or store a copy of a single channel commonly used for analyses with artifacts removed. The .lfp.mat has within it a single struct called lfpprocessName.
File naming format: baseName.lfpprocessName.lfp.mat
(eg. '/recording1/recording1.CA1Wavelets.lfp.mat')

Struct fields (required):

data: a [Nt x Nd] matrix of the processed LFP data (i.e. for 100 wavelet frequencies, Nd=100, for beta band-filtered signal from 56 channels, Nd=56)
timestamps: a [Nt x 1] vector of timestamps
samplingRate: sampling frequency of the processed LFP
channels: channel numbers(s) from which the LFP came (0-indexed)
Struct fields (optional):

duration: length (in seconds) of recording
params: parameters used in processing of the LFP
freqs: frequencies of each dimension (if applicable)
region: brain region where the recording site is
