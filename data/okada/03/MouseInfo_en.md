The recording environments were as follows:
Day1: Home cage
Day2: Novel environment
Day3: Home cage
Day4: Novel environment

The recording started just before entering a night cycle.

Video capturing timings were recorded as "analog input", which is in NS3 file.
Note: There was a trouble with the video recording on DAY2. Thus, the recording was restarted at the time.

Tetrodes were inserted in the right hippocampus (AP:-1.8, LM:+2.0). Tetrode-inserting operations were performed in the following order: tt6, tt2, tt7, tt4 (from medial to temporal direction).


## Details
analog input: During rectangular waves are injected, the video capturing were performed.
   tt2, 6, 7: LFP (= local field potential) in the hippocampus
         tt8: MEP (= myoelectric potential) in the trapezius
