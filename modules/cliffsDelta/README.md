This is code to calculate the Cliff's Delta effect size metric, which strangely is not in NumPy/SciPy.stats.

@Timm had [this as a gist](https://gist.github.com/timm/a6e759eb7d9b5f05b468), and @mtorchiano has [R code with tests](https://github.com/mtorchiano/effsize). I have merged them. Well, Marco's code does a lot more. I merged his tests.
